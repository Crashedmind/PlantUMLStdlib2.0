Design Principles
===============================================================================

The Principles on which this guide are based:

#. Learn by Playing: All examples include a link to allow you to edit and play with them easily - no setup required.
#. Documentation-Of-Code Documentation-As-Code: documentation of the examples, and the example source live together in the same directory in Git. 
#. Open source - anyone can contribute to, or fork, this guide.
#. It must be fun to write it - and to read it.
#. To teach is to learn twice. If I knew all this info already, I would have no interest in writing this guide. There's no better way to learn than by writing a guide for others - and having the master on hand to provide insights as you go.
